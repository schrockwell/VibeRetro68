# Produce a BinHex 4.0 (.hqx) file from MacDown.bin.
#
# BinHex is text-safe and self-contained: it embeds the file name,
# type, creator, Finder flags, and both forks into a 7-bit ASCII
# stream. StuffIt Expander on every classic Mac handles it without
# any preliminary type/creator setup — which makes it the most
# bulletproof way to send a Mac app over a route that strips
# metadata (FTP, plain HTTP, FAT-formatted media, etc.).
#
# Pipeline:
#   1. macbinary decode    .bin   →   real two-fork Mac file on the
#                                     macOS extended-attribute layer
#   2. binhex   encode     file   →   .hqx
#
# Requires Apple's binhex/macbinary tools (shipped with macOS).
#
# Usage: ./scripts/make-hqx.sh <input.bin> <output.hqx>
